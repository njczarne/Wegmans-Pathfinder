# Wegmans-Pathfinder

This app targets people with disabilities by helping them navigate a grocery store efficiently. It takes in grocery items as input and web scrapes the Wegmans website for real-time price and location data. We use a path-finding algorithm to find the most efficient path for the user to take around the store. These results are displayed on an animated graph showing the user navigating through the store and a still graph showing the entire path.

How to use:

1. Run gui.py
2. Select grocery items by checking off the given options or typing anything into the text box
3. After confirming items, do not touch any of the browser windows that will pop up
4. After it is done gathering data, the graphs will be automatically displayed
5. Once you watch the animated graph, you can close it out to see this whole path.

DISCLAIMER: This was a team project and I did not write this whole program
